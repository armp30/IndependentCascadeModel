# IndependentCascadeModel

The Independent Cascade Model is an information diffusion model where the information flows over the network through cascade. Nodes can have two states, active: it means the node is already influenced by the information in diffusion, inactive: node is unaware of the information or not influenced.

Independent Cascade Model highly used in evaluating Influence Maximization Algorithms in Complex Networks where you should choose grouph of seed to spread information across network with graph structured.
